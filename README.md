# Weather-Prediction-with-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Image classification on weather images

# About the project

This project is about classifying weather with different arcitecture of Convolutional Neural Networks.

Models used in this project are as follows:
* CNN
* Inception
* ResNet
* Fully connected

there are different models with these arcitectures. For example, using average-pooling and max-pooling, Dropout and
batch normalization

This project was one of my project of Deep Learning course at University of Guilan in Winter 2022.

## Evaluating

For each model, there are classification report and loss and accuracy plot.

best models were evaluated with K-fold.


## Dataset

The dataset contains 4 classes containing sunrise, shine, rain and cloudy.
